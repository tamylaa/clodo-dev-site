ROI Estimate Methodology

These estimates (time saved, cost reduction, and annual savings) are provided as illustrative examples to help prospective customers evaluate potential impact. Actual results vary depending on workload, traffic patterns, application design, and configuration.

Key points:

- "Time saved" refers to an estimate of development effort reduction when using Clodo's pre-built patterns and deployment automation compared to building a custom serverless stack from scratch.
- "Cost reduction" and "annual savings" are illustrative: they assume a representative workload and may not apply to all customers or usage profiles.
