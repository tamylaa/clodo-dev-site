## 🔥 REVISED GUERRILLA TACTICS (Based on Real Capabilities)

### 1. **"Multi-Tenant SaaS in 10 Lines" Demo Threads**
**Cost: $0** | **Time: 2 hours/week** | **Impact: VERY HIGH**

**Why This Works for Clodo:**
- Multi-tenant is HARD - Clodo makes it easy
- Most frameworks don't handle this well
- This is a REAL differentiator

**The Tactic:**
- Show actual multi-tenant SaaS apps built with Clodo
- Demonstrate: User isolation, database per tenant, auth routing
- Compare: "Here's how you'd do this in Next.js (50+ lines) vs Clodo (10 lines)"

**Example Thread:**
```
1/ I built a multi-tenant SaaS in 10 lines with @clodo_dev 🧵
   No AWS RDS. No complex routing. Just works.

2/ The problem: Building SaaS means handling:
   - User authentication
   - Tenant isolation  
   - Database per tenant
   - Edge deployment
   
   Most frameworks: 100+ lines of boilerplate
   Clodo: 10 lines

3/ Here's the code:
   [Show actual Clodo code with multi-tenant setup]

4/ Deployed to Cloudflare edge. Zero cold starts.
   D1 database per tenant. Built-in auth.
   Cost: $5/month for 100 tenants.

5/ Try it: [Live demo link]
   Docs: [Link to multi-tenant guide]
```
