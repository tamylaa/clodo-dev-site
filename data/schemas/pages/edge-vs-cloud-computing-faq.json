        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Cloud computing centralizes processing in data centers; edge computing processes data near the user or device. The cloud offers massive scalability and complex analytics, while edge minimizes latency and reduces bandwidth for real-time or privacy-sensitive workloads."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Choose edge for ultra-low-latency needs, IoT/high data-rate devices, or when privacy/regulatory requirements demand local processing. Use cloud when you need heavy batch compute, centralized analytics, or simpler operational tooling."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes. A hybrid approach is common: filter and act at the edge, then aggregate and analyze in the cloud. This gives the benefits of both cloud and edge while controlling costs and latency."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use a decision framework: evaluate latency requirements, data volume, privacy, processing complexity, and operational resources. If latency or bandwidth drives requirements, prefer edge; for heavy analytics and central coordination, prefer cloud."
