      "name": "Edge Computing Products",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": If your app processes user requests at the network edge, isolates can handle JavaScript execution without spinning up full VMs. Cloudflare Workers uses this to run code globally with minimal overhead."

    {
      "name": "Microservices Architectures",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": For services that need rapid scaling, isolates provide isolation without the weight of containers. This reduces cold-start times from seconds to milliseconds."

    {
      "name": "Modularize Code",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": Break features into isolated modules that can run in separate V8 contexts. This mirrors microservices but at a finer grain, improving fault tolerance."

      "name": "Resource Management",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": Allocate CPU and memory per isolate, ensuring fair sharing. Tools like Deno or Node.js with worker threads can prototype this."

      "name": "Security by Design",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": Isolates provide sandboxing, reducing attack surfaces. Integrate this early to avoid retrofitting security later."

      "name": "Hybrid Stacks",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": Deploy isolates within containers for portability, or use VMs to manage isolate pools. Kubernetes can orchestrate this, with isolates as pods for fine-grained scaling."
    },
    {
      "name": "Monitoring and Metrics",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": From day one, instrument for isolate-specific metrics like heap usage or execution time. Tools like Prometheus can track these, ensuring efficiency goals are met."

      "acceptedAnswer": ": 50ms cold start is still 10x faster than containers"

      "name": "Use Web Standards",
      "acceptedAnswer": ": Stick to standard Fetch API, Request/Response objects, Web Crypto"
