      "name": "Why StackBlitz Over CodeSandbox/Replit?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "StackBlitz runs Node.js natively in the browser using WebContainers\n                    Faster startup time (no container spin-up)\n                    Native npm install support\n                    Clean GitHub integration\n                    Free for open-source projects"

      "name": "Why Separate Repository for Demo?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "StackBlitz fetches entire repos - we wanted minimal demo, not full framework source\n                    Independent versioning and updates\n                    Cleaner demo experience without framework internals\n                    Can mark as GitHub template for easy forking"

      "name": "Why Commit Hash in URL?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Immutable reference - specific version always works\n                    Bypasses StackBlitz cache\n                    Prevents breaking changes from affecting live demo\n                    Can update main branch while keeping stable demo"
