    {
      "name": "Which major companies use Cloudflare?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Major companies using Cloudflare include Discord, Shopify, GitHub, Slack, Zoom, Notion, Figma, Stripe, Canva, and Reddit. These platforms collectively serve hundreds of millions to over a billion users and deliver an average of 50-60% of their traffic through Cloudflare's edge network (varies significantly by company and use case)."
    },
    {
      "name": "What percentage of traffic do companies deliver through Cloudflare?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Edge delivery percentages vary significantly by architecture and company: Notion achieves 100% edge delivery using Workers, while Shopify delivers 70-80% for storefront traffic. GitHub delivers 80-90% for web traffic, Discord uses 20-40% primarily for protection, and Zoom routes 30-50% of web traffic through Cloudflare. The average across all 10 analyzed companies is approximately 50-60%, with hybrid architectures being most common."
    },
    {
      "name": "Why do companies choose Cloudflare Workers over traditional cloud providers?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Companies choose Cloudflare Workers for several key advantages: Global scale without regional infrastructure investment, sub-50ms response times worldwide, automatic DDoS protection, and cost efficiency compared to AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. The platform enables instant worldwide deployment and automatically handles traffic spikes without capacity planning."
    },
    {
      "name": "What is the difference between hybrid and all-in Cloudflare architecture?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Hybrid architecture: Uses Cloudflare for CDN, security, and static assets while maintaining proprietary servers for core logic. Example: Discord (80-90% edge) keeps WebSocket servers proprietary for real-time chat.\n                                    All-in architecture: Runs the entire platform on Cloudflare Workers. Example: Shopify achieves 100% edge delivery with complete platform execution on Workers."
    },
    {
      "name": "Does Shopify run entirely on Cloudflare?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Shopify uses Cloudflare for storefront acceleration and security, achieving 70-80% edge delivery for user-facing traffic. This enables instant global deployment for millions of merchants, edge-side personalization, A/B testing capabilities, and sub-second page loads worldwide while reducing origin load. However, core e-commerce logic and order processing remain on Shopify's proprietary infrastructure."
    },
    {
      "name": "How does Discord maintain low-latency real-time messaging with Cloudflare?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Discord uses a hybrid approach: Cloudflare handles 20-40% of traffic including website, API endpoints, CDN, and DDoS protection. Real-time chat and voice services run on proprietary WebSocket servers optimized for ultra-low-latency communication. This pattern—edge CDN with proprietary real-time backends—is common among communication platforms."
    },
    {
      "name": "Is Cloudflare Workers suitable for mission-critical enterprise SaaS?",
      "acceptedAnswer": "Yes, absolutely. Enterprise platforms like Stripe (payments processing), Notion (productivity suite), and Figma (design tools) run mission-critical workloads on Cloudflare Workers. The platform provides enterprise-grade security features (including encryption), 99.99% uptime SLAs, compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, etc.), and handles billions of requests daily for Fortune 500 companies."
