  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Cloudflare Workers and AWS Lambda?",
      "answer": "Cloudflare Workers use V8 isolates that start in under 5ms (vs Lambda's 500ms-10s cold starts), bill only for CPU time (not wall clock time), and run in 330+ cities globally rather than specific AWS regions. This results in up to 80% cost reduction and significantly better global latency."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much can Cloudflare Workers reduce cloud costs?",
      "answer": "Companies like Baselime have reported 80-95% cost reductions when migrating from AWS to Cloudflare Workers, primarily because Workers charge only for CPU time rather than the time code spends waiting on databases, APIs, or AI models."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are V8 isolates in Cloudflare Workers?",
      "answer": "V8 isolates are lightweight sandboxes using the same JavaScript engine that powers Chrome. They start in under 5ms with about 3MB memory overhead, compared to 35MB for a basic Node.js Lambda. A single V8 process can run thousands of isolates concurrently."
    },
    {
      "question": "What services are included in the Cloudflare Workers platform?",
      "answer": "Cloudflare Workers platform includes: D1 (SQLite database at the edge), R2 (S3-compatible storage with zero egress fees), Durable Objects (strongly-consistent coordination), Workers AI (20+ ML models), Queues (event-driven messaging), and KV Storage (key-value store with global distribution)."
    },
    {
      "question": "When should I NOT use Cloudflare Workers?",
      "answer": "Cloudflare Workers may not be ideal for: heavy CPU-bound batch processing (video encoding), applications requiring specific language runtimes (legacy Java, .NET), workloads deeply integrated with AWS-specific services, applications needing more than 128MB memory per request, or teams without JavaScript/TypeScript expertise."
