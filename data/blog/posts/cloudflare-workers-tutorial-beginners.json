  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is Cloudflare Workers?",
      "answer": "Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform that runs JavaScript code at the edge—in 330+ data centers worldwide. Unlike AWS Lambda which runs in specific regions, Workers run close to your users everywhere, resulting in sub-50ms response times globally. Workers use V8 isolates (the same engine that powers Chrome) and start in under 5ms with no cold starts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Cloudflare Workers free?",
      "answer": "Yes! Cloudflare Workers has a generous free tier: 100,000 requests per day, 10ms CPU time per request, and access to Workers KV (key-value storage). This is enough for most personal projects, MVPs, and small production apps. The paid plan ($5/month) includes 10 million requests and more CPU time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I get started with Cloudflare Workers?",
      "answer": "Getting started is simple: 1) Install Wrangler CLI with 'npm install -g wrangler', 2) Authenticate with 'wrangler login', 3) Create a project with 'npm create cloudflare@latest', 4) Write your Worker code in src/index.js, 5) Deploy with 'wrangler deploy'. Your API will be live on a *.workers.dev URL in seconds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What can I build with Cloudflare Workers?",
      "answer": "Cloudflare Workers can handle: REST APIs, authentication/authorization, image optimization, A/B testing, redirects/rewrites, caching logic, webhooks, scheduled tasks (cron), WebSocket servers (with Durable Objects), AI inference (with Workers AI), and full-stack apps with database (D1) and storage (R2)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between Cloudflare Workers and AWS Lambda?",
      "answer": "Key differences: 1) Cold starts: Workers start in <5ms vs Lambda's 500ms-10s, 2) Location: Workers run in 330+ cities vs Lambda's ~30 regions, 3) Billing: Workers charge CPU time only vs Lambda's wall-clock time, 4) Pricing: Workers free tier is 100K req/day vs Lambda's 1M req/month, 5) Runtime: Workers use V8 isolates vs Lambda's containers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use npm packages with Cloudflare Workers?",
      "answer": "Yes, but with caveats. Workers support npm packages that don't rely on Node.js-specific APIs (like fs, net, child_process). Most utility libraries (lodash, date-fns, zod) work perfectly. For Node.js APIs, Cloudflare provides compatibility flags and polyfills. Check the Cloudflare docs for the Node.js compatibility matrix."
