## Next steps for keyword research
- Use a keyword tool (Ahrefs/SEMrush/Ubersuggest/Google Keyword Planner) to get exact search volumes and CPC.
- Extract SERP features for each keyword (FAQ, People Also Ask, featured snippets) and prioritize pages that can target those features.
- Finalize primary & secondary keyword lists and assign each to a recommended page from `keyword_mapping_extended.csv`.
