## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

```
Schema not showing in Google?
├─ Wait 24-48 hours (normal recrawl time)

├─ Verify property names (schema.org reference)
├─ Test in Google Rich Results: search.google.com/test/rich-results
└─ Fix & resubmit URL to Google Search Console

No AI search citations?
├─ Give it 2-4 weeks (AI engines index slower)
├─ Ensure blogPosting schema on blog posts
├─ Verify content is original/valuable
├─ Check that site is allowed to be indexed
└─ Try searching yourself: ChatGPT, Perplexity

Validation errors?
├─ Use Schema.org Validator: validator.schema.org
├─ Look for missing required properties
├─ Check property spellings (exact case matters)
├─ Use proper data types (dates, URLs, etc.)
└─ Follow type-specific requirements

Traffic didn't increase?
├─ Give it 4-6 weeks (SEO changes take time)
├─ Ensure rich results are actually showing
├─ Check competitor schema (what are they doing?)
├─ Monitor Search Console trending
└─ Consider content quality improvements too
