## üéØ Task Dependency Map

```
CRITICAL PATH:
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sprint 1: Foundation (Required for consistency)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 1: Hero Grid (independent)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 2: Button System (independent)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 3: SVG Icons (depends on: component system ready)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 4: Text Contrast (independent)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 5: Animation Fixes (independent)

THEN: Sprint 2 (Builds on Sprint 1)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tasks 6-15 can be done in any order
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 6: Feature Hierarchy (depends on: standardized components)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 7: Testimonials (independent)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 8: Stats Section (independent)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Task 9: Navigation (depends on: styles ready)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Others are largely independent

FINALLY: Sprint 3 (Enhancement)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ All independent, can be cherry-picked
```

## üö® Critical Path Items (Must-Do)

These items block other work or have highest impact:

```
MUST DO FIRST:
1. ‚úÖ Hero Grid Proportions - Fixes layout foundation
2. ‚úÖ Button System Standardization - Affects 10+ places in code
3. ‚úÖ Icon System - Affects benefits, features, sections
4. ‚úÖ Text Contrast - Accessibility blocker

RECOMMENDED EARLY:
5. Animation Jank - Performance perception
6. Feature Hierarchy - Core messaging improvement
7. Navigation States - UX clarity
```

## üìû Questions to Resolve

Before implementation:
1. [ ] What's the primary conversion goal? (Docs? GitHub? Newsletter?)
2. [ ] Do you have real stats data to populate?
3. [ ] Should dark mode be included in Sprint 3?
4. [ ] Are there case studies/testimonials available?
5. [ ] Browser support requirements? (Old IE? Or modern only?)
6. [ ] Analytics platform in use? (For measuring impact)
7. [ ] Timeline constraints? (Hard deadline?)
8. [ ] Mobile-first or desktop-first priority?
