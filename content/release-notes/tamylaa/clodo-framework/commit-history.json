InputCollector Readline Health:\n   - Lazy initialization via ensureReadline()\n   - Auto-recreate if closed or corrupted\n   - Check stdin.readable before prompts\n   - Proper cleanup in close() with null reference\n\n3. Auto-Select Single Domain:\n   - Eliminates prompt when only 1 domain available\n   - Bypasses readline issue entirely for common case\n   - Clear feedback to user\n\n4. Timeout Protection:\n   - 120s timeout on all question() calls\n   - Helpful error messages on timeout\n   - Suggests non-interactive mode\n\n5.
